> The AppGameKit target

The AppGameKit target is a wrapper for [AppGameKit](https://www.appgamekit.com) by [TheGameCreators](https://www.thegamecreators.com). It features a powerful API which covers a huge variety of topicsfor game development.

Currently only Windows Desktop, OSX Desktop, Android (Google) and iOS are supported as a target platform.

>> You will need

For OSX and iOS you only need to install XCode from the Apple Appstore.

To target Android, you need to install Android Studio with the NDK as well.

On Windows you need to install Microsoft Visual Studio Community 2017 edition
 
* [Download it here](https://www.visualstudio.com/de/vs/older-downloads/)

Wait until while the installer loads. Once loaded, you’ll be presented with many different options for
which modules you want to install. Under the Workloads tab, tick Desktop development with C++.
Expand Desktop development with C++, and tick the optional components “Windows XP support for
C++” and “C++/CLI support”, as well as the ones that are ticked by default. Then click install.

Next you need to build and run the [[../../tools/build_agk/BuildTargets.cxs|BuildTargets]] script. This will actually create the agk2 module, the help files and the targets. Please run it after you have installed AGK and set the AGK_PATH variable inside your [[Trans]] config file.

>> Notes

The `AGK_PATH` var in your [[Trans]] config file must be set correctly. For an example like this:
<pre>
AGK_PATH="C:\Program Files (x86)\The Game Creators\AGK2"
</pre>

To target Android with AGK, The `ANDROID_PATH` and `ANDROID_NDK_PATH` var in your [[Trans]] config file must be set correctly. For an example like this:
<pre>
ANDROID_PATH="D:\Program Files\Android\Android Studio"
ANDROID_NDK_PATH="C:\Users\mike\AppData\Local\Android\Sdk\ndk\21.1.6352462"
</pre>

The MSBUILD_PATH var in your [[Trans]] config file must be set correctly. For an example like this:
<pre>
MSBUILD_PATH="${PROGRAMFILES(x86)}\Microsoft Visual Studio\2017\Community\MSBuild\15.0\Bin\MSBuild.exe"
</pre>

For more details about the AGK API, please consult its [official documentation](https://www.appgamekit.com/documentation/home.html). This help file is just a quick solution to give you an inbuild quick help.

>> Important

In AGK targets, the all media has to be stored inside the *media* folder and also when you access them, add a "media/" prefix to the filename.
It won't be set automatically.
