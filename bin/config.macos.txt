' IMPORTANT: DO NOT USE FILE PATHS THAT CONTAIN SPACES!
' System and Cerberus root environment variables can be passed using the macro : ${THE_VAR_TO_USE}
' On Mac OS, the only system environment variable of any use is the HOME system environment variable.
' Others can be added to the end of the hidden files relevant to the default shell that Mac OS uses e.g .profile or .bashrc.
' See the relevant documentation for shell config files or search forums on this subject.
'
' On Mac OS. Applications can be installed either as an application bundle (.app), or as a package (.pkg) and by third-party tools like home-brew and macports.
' The user has administrator rights to do some setup and know how to set groups and file permissions, and if using an external sources; must
' knows how how to mount those external sources, be they a local drive or samba if working over a MS Windows network.
'
' It can also be useful to use symbolic links to these locations created in the users home directory, to point to the target folders or files if
' the drive where the users home folder is limited for space.
' For example, assuming that 'devdrive' is pre-mounted, set with the correct file access mount options, group and file permissions:
' ln -s /mnt/devdrive/Android/Sdk $HOME/Android/Sdk

' Java dev kit path (JDK)
'
' Must be set to a valid directory for ANDROID and FLASH target support
'
' If using Android Studio, It is possible that the install will have a much newer version of a JDK, but
' it could be incompatible with the current release of Cerberus X. If that's the case, then a different JDK must be installed.
'
' Alternative to the repository JDK's can be found from:
' Oracle JDK, found here: https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/
' OpenJDK. You can see which vendors offer this from https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenJDK
' NOTE: The wiki only links to the vendors main websites, so a search for OpenJDK on their sites will be needed.
'
' NOTE: Some JDK installations use a combined JDK/JRE, so make sure that the path chosen has the Java compiler (javac)
' within the bin subfolder.
'
' If Android Studio is to be used, then the default location depends on where the Application is to installed.
' Normally on Mac OS, this would be the Applications folder, so default JDK_PATH should be set to use the embedded JDK found
' in the Android Studio installation location.
' /Applications/Android Studio.app/Contents/jre/Contents/Home
'

JDK_PATH="/Applications/Android Studio.app/Contents/jre/Contents/Home"

' Android SDK and tool paths.
'
' Must be set to a valid directory for ANDROID target support
' 
' If using Android Studio, the default location for the installation of the Android SDK is in $HOME/Library/Android/sdk
' To confirm that this is where the Android Sdk is installed, start Android Studio and locate the SDK Manager. See the Android Studio documentation on how to do this.
' It will show the location of where the current Android SDK is and if it's different, then the ANDROID_PATH configuration variable should be updated to this path.
' NOTE: For the Android SDK to work successfully, it must be located in a folder that does not require elevated privileges.
'
