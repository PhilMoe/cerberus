' IMPORTANT: DO NOT USE FILE PATHS THAT CONTAIN SPACES!
' NOTE: System and Cerberus root environment variables can be passed using the macro : ${THE_VAR_TO_USE}
' Where possible, these should be used instead of using full qualifying paths to common MS Windows locations.
' An alternative is to enable developer mode and the create symbolic links in the default locations that
' point to the true installations of the SDK's and tools.
' example: MKLINK /D %LOCALAPPDATA%\Android\Sdk D:\devtools\sdks\Android\Sdk
'
' For more information on symbolic links:

'
' ***** CAUTION! *****
' Creating symbolic links on MS Windows does have certain disadvantages when copying files!
' The system is pretty dumb and will copy the file, or folder and it's contents. 
'
' The other method is to set up some system environment variables to point to the development kits via the MS Window
' environment variables editor.
'
' The most common environment variables that can be used here for MS Windows 10/11 and locations are:
'
' ${PROGRAMFILES(x86)} or ${PROGRAMFILES}
' expands to C:\Program Flies (x86) or C:\Program Flies
' NOTE: On a 64 bit version of the operating system, 32 bit applications will be installed to C:\Program Flies (x86)
'
' ${LOCALAPPDATA}
' expands to C:\User\PcUserLoginName\APPDATA\Local
'
' ${APPDATA}
' expands to C:\User\PcUserLoginName\APPDATA\Local\Roaming
'
' ${USERPROFILE}
' expands to %SystemDrive%\Users\%USERNAME%
' example C:\Users\PcUserLoginName
'
' ${CERBERUSDIR}
' expands to the location of where the Cerberus root folder is.
'
' You can find a full list of environment variables from: https://ss64.com/nt/syntax-variables.html

' Cerberus modules path
'
' Can be overridden. See the Cerberus X documentation on the transcc command line tool
'

' Cerberus targets path

' Can be overridden. See the Cerberus X documentation on the transcc command line tool

'--------------------
' HTML player path.
'
' Must be set for HTML5 target support.
'
' The cserver is used to provide a mini web server for opening .html files...
'

HTML_PLAYER="${CERBERUSDIR}\bin\cserver_winnt.exe"
'--------------------

'--------------------
' MinGW path.
'
' Must be set to a valid directory for desktop/stdcpp target support.
'
' ***** DO NOT USE *****
' mingw64-5.1.0 as it has a linker bug
'
' ***** CAUTION *****
' 64 bit versions based on mingw64-w64 greater than 8.1.0 have issues creating application with Cerberus X output code *****
'
' Recommended version of MinGW is currently here: https://www.cerberus-x.com/downloads/tdm-gcc-64.zip
' This version should be extracted to the Cerberus X directory and the MINGW_PATH set to MINGW_PATH="${CERBERUSDIR}\TDM-GCC-64"
'
' The most common location for a MinGW installation is to place the whole MinGW folder to system drive e.g C:\MinGw.
' Different MinGW vendors would use their own naming for the root directory of their MinGW distribution.
' But as some users will not have administrator rights, then a different location should be selected
' and the MINGW_PATH configuration variable updated to where that MinGW tool chain is installed.
' NOTE: Some installers give you the option to add MinGW to the systems PATH environment variable.
' In this case, the MINGW_PATH would only need to be set if there is more than one version of MinGW installed and the first entry
' in environment PATH is not to be used.

MINGW_PATH="C:\TDM-GCC-64"

'--------------------
' Java dev kit path (JDK)
'
' Must be set to a valid directory for ANDROID and FLASH target support
'
' It is possible that the Android Studio install will have a much newer version of a JDK, but
' it could be incompatible with the current release of Cerberus X. If that's the case, then a
' different JDK must be installed.
'
' The Java JDK is current available here: https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/
' The alternative JDK to use is OpenJDK. You can see which vendors offer this from https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenJDK
' NOTE: The wiki only links to the vendors main websites, so a search for OpenJDK on their sites will be needed.
'
' Normally Windows installers will place a JDK or Android Studio in the C:\Program Files or C:\Program Files(x86) folder.
' But stand alone archives can be extracted and placed elsewhere.
'
' NOTE: Some JDK installers use a combined JDK/JRE, so make sure that the path chosen has the Java compiler (javac)
' within the bin subfolder.
' 
' You should update the JDK_PATH configuration variable to the path of the JDK that is to be used.
' The default JDK_PATH is set to use the embedded JDK in the Android Studio installation location.
' C:\Program Files\Android\Android Studio\jre
'

JDK_PATH="${PROGRAMFILES}\Android\Android Studio\jbr"
'--------------------

'--------------------
' Android SDK and tool paths.
'
' Must be set to a valid directory for ANDROID target support
' 
' If using Android Studio, the default location for the installation of the Android SDK is in C:\User\PcUserLoginName\APPDATA\Local\Android\Sdk
' To confirm that this is where the Android Sdk is installed, start Android Studio and locate the SDK Manager. See the Android Studio documentation on how to do this.
' It will show the location of where the current Android SDK is and if it's different, then the ANDROID_PATH configuration variable should be updated to this path.
' NOTE: For the Android SDK to work successfully, it must be located in a folder that does not require elevated privileges.

ANDROID_PATH="${LOCALAPPDATA}\Android\Sdk"
'--------------------

'--------------------
' Android NDK
'
' Must be set to a valid directory for ANDROID NDK target support
'
' The Android NDK tools are not currently used, but is here if it should be used in the future.
' Android Studio installs NDK's by version number. The are downloaded via Android SDK tools and
' are located in a subfolder called ndk located in the Android SDK folder.

'--------------------
' MSBUILD path.
'
' Must be set for XNA and GLFW target support when not using a MinGW compiler.
'
' The tool for building with Visual Studio is MSBuild.exe. This tools can be located in any number of locations.
' As from Visual Studio 2017, all Visual Studio Editions using the default install locations, use the release year, the edition and the version number of MSBuild:
' examples:
' MSBUILD_PATH="${PROGRAMFILES}\Microsoft Visual Studio\2022\Community\MSBuild\Current\Bin\MSBuild.exe"
' MSBUILD_PATH="${PROGRAMFILES}\Microsoft Visual Studio\2019\Community\MSBuild\16.0\Bin\MSBuild.exe"
