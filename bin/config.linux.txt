' IMPORTANT: DO NOT USE FILE PATHS THAT CONTAIN SPACES!
' System and Cerberus root environment variables can be passed using the macro : ${THE_VAR_TO_USE}
' On Linux, the only system environment variable of any use is the HOME system environment variable.
' Others can be added to the end of the hidden files .profile or .bashrc. See the Linux distributions documentation or forums on this subject.
'
' For the average Linux user. All applications not part of the Linux distributions repositories
' should be placed in the users home directory. Files and folders can be relocated elsewhere, but requires that
' the user has administrator rights, knows how to set groups and file permissions, and if using an external source;
' knows how how to mount those external sources, be they a local drive or samba if working over a MS Windows network.
'
' It can also be useful to use symbolic links to these locations created in the users home directory to point to the target folders or files if
' the drive where the users home folder is limited for space.
' For example, assuming that 'devdrive' is pre-mounted, set with the correct file access mount options, group and file permissions:
' ln -s /mnt/devdrive/Android/Sdk $HOME/Android/Sdk
' 
' Linux distributions will have a number of options on managing different versions of a Java Development Kit and compilers that can live side-by-side.
' Most distributions may already have these developer tools pre-installed, but many will not and will have to be manually installed and require
' administrator privileges to do so.
'
' Some distributions do have installed graphical package managers. These can be pretty limited, but an alternatives can be installed. Search for details on the distributions
' forums for more information.

' Cerberus modules path
'
' Can be overridden. See the Cerberus X documentation on the transcc command line tool
'

MODPATH="${CERBERUSDIR}/modules;${CERBERUSDIR}/modules_ext"
'--------------------

'--------------------
' HTML player path.
'
' Must be set for HTML5 target support.
'
' The cserver is used to provide a mini web server for opening .html files...
'

HTML_PLAYER="${CERBERUSDIR}/bin/cserver_linux"
'--------------------

'--------------------
' Java dev kit path (JDK)
'
' Must be set to a valid directory for ANDROID and FLASH target support
'
' Normally a JDK would be installed via the Linux distribution's package manager, but a different version can be downloaded and extracted
' and used. You should update the JDK_PATH configuration variable to the path of the JDK that is to be used.
'
' If using Android Studio, It is possible that the install will have a much newer version of a JDK, but
' it could be incompatible with the current release of Cerberus X. If that's the case, then a different JDK must be installed.
'
' Alternative to the repository JDK's can be found from:
' Oracle JDK, found here: https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/
' OpenJDK. You can see which vendors offer this from https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenJDK
' NOTE: The wiki only links to the vendors main websites, so a search for OpenJDK on their sites will be needed.
'
' NOTE: Some JDK installations use a combined JDK/JRE, so make sure that the path chosen has the Java compiler (javac)
' within the bin subfolder.
'
' If Android Studio is to be used, then the default location depends on where the Application is to installed.
' Normally this would be the user's home directory under 'android-studio, so default JDK_PATH should be
' set to use the embedded JDK found in the Android Studio installation location.
' $HOME/android-studio/jre
'

JDK_PATH="${HOME}/android-studio/jre"
'--------------------

'--------------------
' Android SDK and tool paths.
'
' Must be set to a valid directory for ANDROID target support
' 
' If using Android Studio, the default location for the installation of the Android SDK is in $HOME/Android/Sdk
' To confirm that this is where the Android Sdk is installed, start Android Studio and locate the SDK Manager. See the Android Studio documentation on how to do this.
' It will show the location of where the current Android SDK is and if it's different, then the ANDROID_PATH configuration variable should be updated to this path.
' NOTE: For the Android SDK to work successfully, it must be located in a folder that does not require elevated privileges.
'

ANDROID_PATH="${HOME}/Android/Sdk"
'--------------------

'--------------------
' Android NDK
'
' Must be set to a valid dir for ANDROID NDK target support
'
' The Android NDK tools are not currently used, but is here if it should be used in the future.
' Android Studio installs NDK's by version number. The are downloaded via Android SDK tools and
' are located in a subfolder called ndk located in the Android SDK folder.

ANDROID_NDK_PATH="${HOME}/Android/Sdk/ndk/23.0.7599858"

' Depreciated Targets
' These targets are no longer supported and are commented out. They are only here for reference.
'
' Apache ANT is the main build system for Flash and at one point for Android.
' On Linux distributions, it's usually installed via the distributions package manager and it's often
' used by other application.
'
' The Flex SDK is the software development kit for Flash enabled web applications.
' It's still available from https://flex.apache.org/
' With the advance of HTML5, Flash is seldom used any more and Flash player and it's web browser plugin reached it's
' End of Life on December 31 2020.
' You can still download the flash player debugger from https://www.adobe.com/support/flashplayer/debug_downloads.html

' Flex SDK and flash player path.
'
' FLEX_PATH Must be set for FLASH target support.
'
' Either HTML_PLAYER or FLASH_PLAYER must be set for FLASH target support.
' Flex is current supported by the Apache Foundation and is currently here https://flex.apache.org/index.html

' Set the FLASH_PLAYER to the location of the Flash Player plugin
' for opening .swf files...cerberus will use HTML_PLAYER if this is not set.
