# Monk

**Monk** is a free code editor by Simon Armstrong for monkey that works on both Windows and Apple computers.


## Alternatives

Windows users that find Monk too simple have an alternative option named [[Jungle]].

Also available are [Plugins](http://www.gingerbeardman.com/monkey) for code editors such as TextMate BBEdit TextWrangler and Sublime.

## Version

The current version of Monk is 0.37 which adds Monkey function highlight and integrated Help with this Wiki.

## Features

Monk can archive every version of source saved in it's history folder.

Monk has an optional set of key bindings. Select **Use OS Specific Shortcut Keys** in File->IDE Options if you prefer more traditional keyboard bindings.

The Escape key in Monk can be used to quickly return to the code editor from either the Output or Help tabs. 


## Source code

**Monk** is written in BlitzMax and is based on a recent fork of MaxIDE.

The source code is public domain and can be found in the %monkey%/src folder.
