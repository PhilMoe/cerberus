# Module mojo.graphics

The graphics module contains various functions that allow you to draw 2D graphics on all supported monkey target platforms.

The module supports rendering of file based images, and a small set of simple primitives.

Transparency effects can be achieved using SetAlpha to set the global alpha level, and fullscreen rotation and scaling effects can be achieved using the various matrix commands such as Translate, Rotate and Scale.

The graphics module is state based, and commands that 'set' various states will remain in effect until a subsequent 'set' modifies the state.


# Const AlphaBlend:Int


# Const AdditiveBlend:Int


# Function DeviceWidth:Int()

Returns the width of the graphics device, in pixels.

Please note that you cannot directly control the size of the graphics device via mojo. This must be done by editing the 'native' project code for the target.

## See also

[[DeviceHeight]]


# Function DeviceHeight:Int()

Returns the height of the graphics device, in pixels.

Please note that you cannot directly control the size of the graphics device via mojo. This must be done by editing the 'native' project code for the target.

# Function LoadImage:Image(path:String,frameCount:Int=1,flags:Int=Image.DefaultFlags)

Loads an image from path.

The frames of a multi-frame image must be laid out in a single horizontal strip, in which case the width of the image is the width of image file divided by the number of frames, and the height of the image is the height of the image file.

The image must be a PNG or JPEG image format, and must have the three-letter file extension .png or .jpg (not .jpeg). PNGs with alpha transparency channels are supported.

Like all game data, the image file must be saved in your project's .data folder or one of its sub-folders.

If your images contain edge padding, you will need to use one of the padding flags such as XYPadding.

See DefaultFlags for a list of valid image flags.

## Parameters

path - the data file path of the image to load, relative to your applications .data folder.

frameCount - the number of frames contained in the image.

flags - image flags.

The image must be a PNG or JPEG image format, and must have the three-letter file extension .png or .jpg (not .jpeg). PNGs with alpha transparency channels are supported.

Like all game data, the image file must be saved in your project's .data folder or one of its sub-folders.

If your images contain edge padding, you will need to use one of the padding flags such as XYPadding.

See DefaultFlags for a list of valid image flags.

## Parameters

path - the data file path of the image to load, relative to your applications .data folder.

frames - the number of frames contained in the image.

frameWidth - width of each frame.

frameHeight - height of each frame.

flags - image flags.

# Function SetColor:Int(r:Float,g:Float,b:Float)

Sets the current color.

The current color is used by all drawing operations except Cls.

Note: Drawing images in any color other than 255,255,255 on the HTML5 target will incur a major runtime overhead. For best results on the HTML5 target, either use colored imaged sparingly, or consider using 'pre-colored' images stored in multiple image files.

## Parameters

red, green, blue - color components in the range 0 to 255.

## See also

[[GetColor]]


# Function GetColor:Float[]()

Returns the current color as a 3 component float array containg the current color's red, green and blue components respectively.

## See also

The length of @color must be at least 3.

## See also

[[SetColor]]


# Function SetAlpha:Int(alpha:Float)

Sets the current global alpha level.

Alpha controls the 'mixing' that occurs when rendering. An alpha value of 1 results in completely opaque rendering, while 0 results in completely transparent rendering.

In the case of images which contain alpha, the alpha used for rendering is the product of each image pixel's alpha and the current global alpha.

Global alpha affects all drawing operations except for Cls.

## Parameters

alpha - alpha value in the range 0 to 1.

The current blending mode affects all drawing commands except for Cls.

The mode parameter can be one of the following:

<pre>
AlphaBlend
AdditiveBlend
</pre>

## Parameters

mode - the blend mode to set.

## See also

[[GetBlend]]


# Function GetBlend:Int()

</pre>

## See also

[[SetBlend]]


# Function SetScissor:Int(x:Float,y:Float,width:Float,height:Float)

@arrayOffset - optional array offset.

@arrayPitch - optional array pitch.
