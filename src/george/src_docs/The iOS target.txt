# The iOS target

iOS is Appleu2019s OS for iTouch, iPhone and iPad devices.

## You will need

* Apple Mac computer runnning OS X 10.6 or better.

* [XCode](http://itunes.apple.com/nz/app/xcode/id448457090?mt=12) developer tools with iOS SDK.

## Notes

You can develop programs on the iPhone simulator free of charge.

To be able to download iOS programs to actual iOS devices, you will need to join Appleu2019s developer program which currently costs about $100USD per year.

To actually run a Monkey app on a real iDevice, you will need to manually open the output xcode project (.buid/ios/MonkeyGame.xcodeproj) in xcode, select 'device' as the target and build and run.

To modify supported device orientations - for example, to force landscape mode for an app - you will need to edit the projectu2019s info.plist in xcode.
