# Class mojo.audio.Sound

Sound objects contain audio data preloaded from files.

Sound objects can be created using the [[LoadSound]] function - please refer to the [[mojo.audio]] module for more details.


# Method Discard:Int()

The Discard method frees up any low level resources being used by the sound.

All sounds will eventually be discarded by memory management anyway, so you don't usually need to worry about using this method. However, if you are using lots of large sounds and memory is tight, you may prefer to manually discard sounds yourself.

Once discarded, a sound should be consider invalid and not used again.
