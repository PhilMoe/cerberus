# Keyword End

Declares the end of a class, function, method or similar block-style definition, or of certain loop or conditional blocks.

## Syntax

End [ *block opening keyword* ]

## Description

The End keyword closes off a class, function, method or similar block (eg. interfaces, future additions), but may also be used in place of block-specific keywords which close certain loops or conditional blocks (ie. those that don't need to perform testing at the end of the block).

End may also be combined with a space followed by the block opening keyword. For example, a Class block may be closed by End or End Class according to individual preference.

Some examples are listed below.

*Class-block closing options:*
<pre>
Class/End		Class/End Class
</pre>

*Function-block closing options:*
<pre>
Function/End	Function/End Function
</pre>

*If-block closing options:*
<pre>
If/Endif		If/End		If/End If
</pre>

*Select-block closing options:*
<pre>
Select/End		Select/End Select
</pre>

*For-loop closing options:*
<pre>
For/Next		For/End		For/End For
</pre>

*While-block closing options:*
<pre>
While/Wend		While/End	While/End While
</pre>
