The main Monkey app is a stub app that launches Ted, the monkey text editor.

On Windows, it also manages the Monkey.monkeycoder.co.nz and .monkey subkeys in HKEY_CURRENT_USE/Software/Classes - ie: you must run Monkey to add file type.

On Mac, it launches a new instance of Ted if used with cmd line args.

In future, it may also start up a server etc.
