PLEASE NOTE:
Before you begin. You should check out one of the desktop sub forums for any issues and workarounds, or to ask questions.

Requirements:
For Standard Desktop Console, Desktop Game and iOS targets. Both XCode and the XCode command line tools should be installed.
For Android Game targets, an Android Studio installation is recommended, but it is possible to do a manual setup using the command line tools.

If all the above are installed to their default locations, then Cerberus should not need any additional set up.
But if required, modify the config.winnt.txt file locate in the Cerberus bin directory with the path to those build tools.
The config.macos.txt also contains addition information on setting up Cerberus X requirements.
