> Ted

Ted is a simple text editor/IDE for Cerberus X.

Ted is written in C++ and [Qt](http://qt.nokia.com/products/), and is located in the Cerberus X 'bin' directory along with any necessary Qt libraries.

Normally, you should not need to run Ted directly. Instead, use the [[Cerberus X]] app in the main Cerberus X directory which launches Ted for you.
