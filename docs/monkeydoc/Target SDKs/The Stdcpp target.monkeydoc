> The Stdcpp target

The stdcpp (standard c++) target allows you to write command line utilities in Monkey.

>> You will need

* (Windows) [MinGW 4.9.2](http://www.monkeycoder.co.nz/downloads/tdm-gcc-4.9.2.exe).

* [XCode](http://developer.apple.com/xcode) developer tools.

>> Notes

On Windows, you will need to set the `MINGW_PATH` var in your [[Trans]] config file. This should point to the actual MinGW directory, not the 'bin' sub-directory.
