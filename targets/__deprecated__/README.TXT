
Deprecated targets.

Targets are deprecated if it is no longer possible to publish them (eg: XNA, PSM) or they have become superceded by improved versions (eg: Android, Glfw).

It is still possible to use deprecated targets - just move the target directory back up to the top level 'targets' directory. However, getting them going is up to you...
