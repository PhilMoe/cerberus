This directory contains target template projects and modules.

Several C++ targets make use of the stb_image and/or stb_vorbis libs, Sean Barrett's very cool image and audio libs - see: http://nothings.org.

The GLFW target uses GLFW, a nice GLUT-like OpenGL wrapper - see: http://www.glfw.org/

The PSM, Windows 8 and Window Phone 8 targets are experimental and may be removed in future.
