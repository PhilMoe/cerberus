' Monkey is not thread safe - nothing is safe to call.

' C++ threads must not create arrays or objects, or modify elements/variables/fields etc that contain arrays or objects. Strings might be OK.

' This is undocced, as it's mainly intended for use only by native code, but might be fun to play with in monkey...good for testing anyway!
