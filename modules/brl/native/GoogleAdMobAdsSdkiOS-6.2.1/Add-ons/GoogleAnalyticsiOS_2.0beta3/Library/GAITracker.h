 Google Analytics tracking interface. Obtain instances of this interface from
 [GAI trackerWithTrackingId:] to track screens, events, transactions, timing,

 The tracking identifier (the string that begins with "UA-") this tracker is

 wish to override this property, you must do so before making any tracking
 calls.

/*!
 The application identifier associated with this tracker. This should be set to
 the iTunes Connect application identifier assigned to your application. By
 default, this property is `nil`. If you wish to set this property, you must do
 so before making any tracking calls.

 Note that this is not your app's bundle id (e.g. com.example.appname), but the
 identifier used by the App Store.

 Tracking data collected while this is true will be anonymized by the Google
 Analytics servers by zeroing out some of the least significant bits of the
 IP address.

 In the case of IPv4 addresses, the last octet is set to zero. For
 IPv6 addresses, the last 10 octets are set to zero, although this is subject to
 change in the future.

 By default, this flag is false.

 Tracking information collected while this is true will be submitted to Google
 Analytics using HTTPS connection(s); otherwise, HTTP will be used. Note that
 there may be additional overhead when sending data using HTTPS in terms of
 processing costs and/or battery consumption.

 By default, this flag is false.

/*!
 The sampleRate parameter controls the probability that the visitor will be
 sampled. By default, sampleRate is 100, which signifies no sampling. sampleRate
 may be set to any value between 0 and 100, inclusive. A value of 90 means 90%
 of visitors should be sampled (10% of visitors to be sampled out).

 When a visitor is not sampled, no data is collected by Google Analytics for iOS
 library about that visitor's activity. If your application is subject to heavy
 traffic spikes, you may wish to adjust the sample rate to ensure uninterrupted
 report tracking. Sampling in Google Analytics occurs consistently across unique
 visitors, ensuring integrity in trending and reporting even when sampling is
 enabled, because unique visitors remain included or excluded from the sample,
 as set from the initiation of sampling.
 */

 The client ID for the tracker.

 This is a persistent unique identifier generated the first time the library is
 called and persisted unchanged thereafter. It is used to identify the client
 across multiple application sessions.

/*!
 The current screen set for this tracker.

 Calling trackView: will also update this property before it dispatches tracking
 information to Google Analytics. However, if you wish to update the current
 screen without sending any tracking information, set this property directly.
 The updated screen will be reflected in subsequent tracking information.

 The referrer URL for this tracker. Changing this value causes it to be sent

 The campaign URL for this tracker. This is not directly propagated to Google
 Analytics, but if there are campaign parameter(s), either manually or
 auto-tagged, present in this URL, the SDK will include those parameters in the
 next dispatch of tracking information. Google Analytics treats tracking
 information with differing campaign information as part of separate sessions.

 If true, indicates the start of a new session. Note that when a tracker is
 first instantiated, this is initialized to true. To prevent this default
 behavior, set this to `NO` when the tracker is first obtained.

 By itself, setting this does not send any data. If this is true, when the next
 tracking call is made, a parameter will be added to the resulting tracking
 information indicating that it is the start of a session, and this flag will be
 cleared.

 If non-negative, indicates how long, in seconds, the application must
 transition to the inactive or background state for before the tracker will
 automatically indicate the start of a new session when the app becomes active
 again by setting sessionStart to true. For example, if this is set to 30
 seconds, and the user receives a phone call that lasts for 45 seconds while
 using the app, upon returning to the app, the sessionStart parameter will be
 set to true. If the phone call instead lasted 10 seconds, sessionStart will not
 be modified.

 To disable automatic session tracking, set this to a negative value. To
 indicate the start of a session anytime the app becomes inactive or
 backgrounded, set this to zero.

 By default, this is 30 seconds.
